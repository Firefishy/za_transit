This is a repository for transit data for South Africa.

I currently focus on GTFS, but other formats are welcome as well.

Do not submit information directly copied that might have copyright problems. Converted data should be OK, but consult a lawyer if in doubt.

Please let me know if you have some more data available. (Pull requests, issues, etc.)

Currently this is in its initial stages.

The structure is as follows:
province/agency
