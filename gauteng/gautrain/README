Notes:
 - Public holidays added from here: http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/holidays.htm
 - Platforms listed as sub-stops under stations
 - getRoutes.py attempts to create quite up-to-date info to gautrain_unofficial.zip
 - Stations/stops might need some work (through overrides)
 - Many extensions are used
 - getShapes.py will dump the paths in Gautrain_shapes.kml to pyhton format, for adding to getRoutes.py
 - getShapes.py needs at least Python 2.5 (But adding ElementrTree from pypi might work as well)
 - getRoutes.py should be edited to update the feed, rather than the text files directly
 - Currently bus routes are assuming 20 minute service all day with 1 minute travel time between stops
 - update.sh should be used to update the feed (if the Shapes are edited, getShapes must be run manually and inseted into getRoutes.py)
 - kmlfixer.py is to take the KML generated by kmlwriter and convert it to something usable for commuters via Google Earth / Maps
 - kmlfixer is still unimplemented

TODO: (In order of priority)
 - Calculate times for bus trips
 - Add platform details to train trips - Centurion, Marlboro done
 - Check locations, especially of bus terminals and platforms
 - Add Park station details once operational
 - Add bus > train transfers
 - Add train > bus transfers
 - Add airport transfers
 - Add fares
 - Add public holidays past 2012 - calender_dates.txt

Long term goals:
 - Get other commuter services (BRT, Metrobus, Tshwane, Putco, taxi associations, etc.) to ensure their data is available
 - Expand nationwide
 - Get full rail services listed (Shosoloza Meyl and others)
 - Get bus services listed (Roadlink, Translux, Greyhound, etc.)
 - Get airlines listed (Kulula, Mango, British Airways, 1time, SAA)
